### Importing Azure DevOps pipeline
The azure devops pipeline is contained in the 'azure-pipelines.yml' file. If you want to deploy the app to Azure, you will need to update the Deploy stage with your own azure subscription. If you just want to see the tests run in Azure DevOps, I recommend commenting out the whole deploy stage with a `#` symbol.
